- Fix file size - and downsample voltage X

- measure frequency in an interval, tsart, tstop X

- membrane potential diff function X

- rewrite selection critera to return zscore X

- write a in-between function which checks for threshold level, return boolean X

- save volatge and z-score, be able to select the number of traces. X

- Think about plotting the data X

- frequency change only positive

- t_stop modulation defined automatically
